# shell- lab
The lab includes the basic components to use a terminal that was made from scratch with help of sample code colleage aid, and youtube videos. It complies with assigment(hoping didn't misunderstand anything) except some issues that were there with piping.

# runing the program
    to run the program get to **shell/** and run the command **./mishelle.py**. ~~pun intended~~
